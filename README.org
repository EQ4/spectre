#+title: Spectre

This program takes an image (in most common file formats), and uses the Inverse
Fast Fourier Transform equation to convert it to a waveform, which is then
written to an audio file (wav). This file can be (later) compressed as mp3 if
desired.

The Fourier Transform allows us to take a measure of Time and /transform/ to a
measure of Frequency and Amplitude.

Use [[http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/][Sonic Visualiser]] to look at the waveform and spectrogram of the generated
file.

Possible improvements: using Numpy's `ifft2`, the 2-dimensional variant of IFFT,
to process the entire image at once. Converting for-loops to `map` functions.
